# ********************************************************************
#  TAG: prefix
#
#       The prefix to use to generate the archive name.
#       If not defined then the archive name is generated using the
#       rules held in the vars file. If yet missing is automatically
#       generated using the computername.
#
#       Example 
#       prefix=MYArchiveName
#
#		Default
#		prefix=

# ********************************************************************
#  TAG: includesource
#
#       With this tag you can define which are the sources which hold
#       the files to backup.
#
#       You can define each source on it's own line. Each source must
#       be followed by a pipe character and an alias.
#
#       includesource=<target>|alias=<namedcontainer>
#
#       The goal of the alias is to provide a Junction label for the
#       targeted source and, also, to provide a meaningful container
#       name within the resulting compressed backup archive.
#
#       You can set as many sources as you want one per line
#       There must be at least one
#
#       Example
#       includesource=C:\Dir1|alias=Container1
#       includesource=C:\Dir2\Subdir1|alias=Container2
#       includesource=D:\Company\Documents|alias=Public
#       includesource=\\someserver\somesharedfolder|alias=Remote (see note !!)
#
#       NOTE ! From version 1.8.0 of 7zbackup you can also specify
#       UNC paths as sources for your backup but this is possible
#       only if the script is ran on a Windows Vista / 7 / 2008
#       computer.
#
#       Warning !!
#       Do not specify sources that are already below a previously
#       specified source as it will double backup your data.
#
#       Example 
#       includesource=C:\Dir1|alias=Container1
#       includesource=C:\Dir1\Subdir1|alias=Container2 <- WRONG !!!
#
#       Default
#       includesource=

# ********************************************************************
#  TAG: matchincludefiles (optional)
#  
#       Holds the regular expression to test file names against.
#       Every file name (regardless their path) which match this
#       regular expression will be selected and included in the backup
#
#       If you do not specify any matchincludefiles directive then
#       the script will automatically select ALL files with respect
#       to the MAIN include criteria which is the type of backup.
#
#       If you do specify a matchincludefile directive then only
#       filenames matching this expression will be selected.
#
#       You can set as many sources as you want one per line
#
#       Example to backup only *.pst files
#       matchincludefiles=.*\.pst$        
#
#       Example to backup only *.pst files AND *.txt files
#       matchincludefiles=.*\.pst$|.*\.txt$
#
#       - OR -
#       matchincludefiles=.*\.pst$
#       matchincludefiles=.*\.txt$
#        
#       Default (all files are eligible for backup)
#       matchincludefiles=

# ********************************************************************
#  TAG: matchexcludepath (optional)
#  
#       By design behavior 7backup will recurse all subdirectories
#       for any given source.
#       This may cause you to backup some "unwanted" directory which
#       reside below the given source.
#
#       With this regular expression you can specify which paths have
#       to be skipped.
#
#       Imagine you have set D:\Dir1 as source and this directory
#       holds severals subdirs like this
#       D:\Dir1 == aliased as "Container1"
#              \Dir1.1
#              \Dir1.2
#              \Dir1.3
#                     \Dir1.3.1
#              \Dir1.4
#
#       and you do not want to backup Dir1.3 you can specify a regular
#       expression like this: 
#
#       matchexcludepath=^Container1\\Dir1\.3
#
#       This wont stop the digging to further subfolders but obviuosly
#       every subfolder path will match the expression.
#       On the other hand if you want to skip the backup of folder
#       Dir1.3 ONLY and want to let the selection process to go further
#       deep in the directory tree (that means also Dir1.3.1 will be
#       scanned) you can change your regexp like this:
#
#       matchexcludepath=^Container1\\Dir1\.3$
#
#       Please note that in this tag, if you want to refer to the parent
#       root of a directory you have to address the "alias" value of the
#       the source.
#
#       You can set as many directives as you want one per line.
#       Take always care each line DOES NOT END WITH A "|" (pipe)
#
#       Example
#       matchexcludepath=^Container1\\Dir1\.3$
#       matchexcludepath=^Container1\\Dir1\.4
#

# ********************************************************************
#  TAG: matchexcludefiles (optional)
#  
#       Holds the regular expression to test file names against.
#       Every file name (regardless their path) which match this
#       regular expression will be excluded from the selection criteria
#
#       If you do not want to exclude any file upon regex criteria then
#       simply comment this line out.
#
#       Example 
#       matchexcludefiles=.*\.txt$              (to discard *.txt)
#       matchexcludefiles=.*\.txt$|.*\.tmp$     (to discard *.txt AND *.tmp)
#
#       Default
#       matchexcludefiles=thumbs\.db$|.*\.mp3$|.*\~$|.*\.tmp$

matchexcludefiles=thumbs\.db$|.*\.mp3$|.*\~$|.*\.tmp$

# ********************************************************************
#  TAG: matchcleanupfiles (optional)
#  
#       Holds the regular expression to test file names against.
#       Every file name (regardless their path) which match this
#       regular expression will be removed from source during the 
#       scanning/selection process.
#
#       USE WITH GREAT CARE OR YOU WILL LIKELY HAVE ALL OF YOUR
#       IMPORTANT DATA SIMPLY NUCLEARIZED FROM YOUR SOURCES
#
#       Example 
#       matchcleanupfiles=.*\.tmp$              (to delete *.tmp)


# ********************************************************************
#  TAG: maxfileage (optional)
#  
#       Expresses the maxage, in days, a file must have to be selected.
#       Calculation of age is made over LastWriteTime property compared
#       to the date the script started.
#
#       By default this directive is commented out so no date criteria
#       is applied on file selection
#
#       Example : to select files which have changed in the last 10 days
#       maxfileage=10     
#
#       Default
#       maxfileage=0

# ********************************************************************
#  TAG: minfileage (optional)
#  
#       Expresses the minage, in days, a file must have to be selected.
#       Calculation of age is made over LastWriteTime property compared
#       to the date the script started.
#
#       By default this directive is commented out so no date criteria
#       is applied on file selection
#
#       Example : to select files which have over than 10 days ago
#       minfileage=10     
#
#       Default
#       minfileage=0

# ********************************************************************
#  TAG: maxfilesize (optional)
#  
#       Expresses the maxfilesize, in bytes, a file must be to be selected.
#
#       By default this directive is commented out so no date criteria
#       is applied on file selection. Be careful in selecting files
#       of size 0
#
#       Example : to select files which are of size 1MB or lower
#       maxfilesize=1024
#
#       Default
#       maxfilesize=

# ********************************************************************
#  TAG: minfilesize (optional)
#  
#       Expresses the minfilesize, in bytes, a file must be to be selected.
#
#       By default this directive is commented out so no date criteria
#       is applied on file selection. Be careful in selecting files
#       of size 0
#
#       Example : to select files which are of size at least 1MB or higher
#       minfilesize=1024
#
#       Default
#       minfilesize=

# ********************************************************************
#  TAG: matchstoprecurse (optional)
#  
#       Holds the regular expression to test directory names against.
#       Every directory name (full path from Container) which match 
#       this regular expression wont be entered for recursion.
#       In other words recursion into subdirectories will stop
#       if the path to be entered matches this regular expression.
#
#       Example 
#       matchstoprecurse=^Container1\\Dir1\.3   (will NOT enter Container1\Dir1.3)
#       matchstoprecurse=\\DirName              (will NOT enter any directory named "DirName")
#
#       Default
#       matchstoprecurse=

# ********************************************************************
#  TAG: maxdepth (optional)
#  
#       Expresses the maximum recursion level to be reached while 
#       performing a scan on the directory tree in search of files
#       to backup.
#
#  		If not defined the script assumes a maximum level of 100 (default).
#  		The value is zero-based which means a value of zero whil stop the
#  		the scanning at the first level. A value of 1 will allow 1 recursion
#  		level therefore scanning the firs level of subfolders and so on
#
#       Example 
#       maxdepth=100				(default)
#       maxdepth=3					
#
#       Default
#       maxdepth=

# ********************************************************************
#  TAG: rotate (optional)
#  
#  		This variable holds the number of historycal archive backups you
#  		want to keep on target media. An zero value means no rotation
#  		will be performed after succesful archiving and YOU will be in charge
#  		to delete old backups. Pay attention or your target media
#  		will run out of free space soon.
#  		For example: if you set this value to 3 then it means the 3 newest
#  		backups of the current type are kept on target media.
#  		For a "classic" 3 week incremental scheme we suggest to :
#  		rotate=3 for full backups (launched once a week)
#  		rotate=21 for incr backups (launched once per day)
#
#       Example 
#       rotate=5
#
#       Default
#       rotate=

# ********************************************************************
#  TAG: nofollowjunctions (optional)
#  
#       This is a switch tag which means no value is associated
#       to it. 
#       If you uncomment this tag the scan process will not
#       follow junction points: if a junction point is met the
#       scan process will not drop in.
#
#       If this value is commented out then junction points will
#       be followed as normal directories.
#
#       Default
#       nofollowjunctions

# ********************************************************************
#  TAG: useswitches (optional)
#  
#       With this tag you can specify a specific set of switches to
#       be used by 7zip. Fine tuning of 7zip is essential so
#       you may want to adjust compression switches to specific
#       values needed by type of files you're going to archive.
#
#       By default the script will assume switches set in variable
#       Bk7ZipSwitches which is valued in the 7zBackup-vars.ps1
#       script. Defining new swicthes here will override thir values.
#
#       It's essential always to remember to include the -bd switch
#       which will supress 7-zip progress indicator otherwise you will
#       have the compression detail file bloated with hundreds of rows
#       which simply hold percent numbers.
#
#       Default (in 7zbackup-vars.ps1)
#       useswitches=-bd -ssw -mx1 -md=96m -mmt=1 -mtc=on -mf=off -slp -scsUTF-8
